// Documentation for the package:
//
// This package provides a set of utilities for working with collections, including
// lists, maps, and streams. It includes generic data structures and functions
// for manipulating and transforming data. The package is designed to be
// flexible and easy to use, allowing developers to work with collections in a
// more efficient and expressive way. It also includes a fluent API for building
// database connections and repositories, making it easier to interact with
// databases in a type-safe manner. The package is built on top of the GORM
// library, providing a simple and consistent interface for working with
// databases. The package is intended for use in Go applications that require
// advanced data manipulation and database interaction capabilities. It is
// designed to be easy to integrate into existing projects and can be used in
// a variety of contexts, including web applications, command-line tools, and
// background services. The package is open source and can be freely used and
// modified under the terms of the MIT license. It is actively maintained and
// updated to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Go and GORM.

// Thank you!
