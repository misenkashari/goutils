# goutils
JPA utilities in Golang


// Package goutils provides a collection of general-purpose utility functions
// and data structures designed to simplify common tasks in Go applications.
//
// The goal of goutils is to offer developers reusable building blocks that are
// performant, well-tested, and idiomatic. The package is organized into
// subpackages for clarity and modularity. Each subpackage focuses on a specific
// utility domain.
//
// ## Subpackages
//
// - collections: Utility functions and wrappers for working with slices, maps,
//   and other data structures.
//
// ## Features
//
// - Clean and minimal APIs designed for developer productivity.
// - Focus on performance and Go best practices.
// - Designed to complement the Go standard library.
//
// ## Getting Started
//
// To use goutils in your project:
//
//	import "github.com/misenkashari/goutils"
//
// Since most of the core logic lives in subpackages, you'll likely import them directly:
//
//	import "github.com/misenkashari/goutils/collections"
//
// ## License
//
// This project is open-source and available under the MIT license.
//
// Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome!
